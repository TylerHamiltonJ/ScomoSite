            <b>Update! Scott Morrison has now been found, and breifly spoke on the 8th July at 2pm.</b>
            A very big thank you to everyone who worked tirelessly to find him.
            We are now working hard to get him to also contact Victoria to let them know he's safe.
        //- p We are starting to get concerned, and his curry is getting cold.
